Astro uses **file-based routing** to generate your build URLs based on the file layout of your project `src/pages/` directory. When a file is added to the `src/pages` directory of your project, it is automatically available as a route based on its filename.

## Static routes

Astro Components (`.astro`) and Markdown Files (`.md`) in the `src/pages` directory **automatically become pages on your website**. Each pageâ€™s route corresponds to its path and filename within the `src/pages` directory. 

```bash
# Example: Static routes
src/pages/index.astro        -> mysite.com/
src/pages/about.astro        -> mysite.com/about
src/pages/about/index.astro  -> mysite.com/about
src/pages/about/me.astro     -> mysite.com/about/me
src/pages/posts/1.md         -> mysite.com/posts/1
```

> ðŸ’¡ There is no separate "routing config" to maintain in an Astro project. Static pages are created by placing files in the `/src/pages/` directory.

## Dynamic routes

A single Astro Page component can also specify dynamic route parameters in its filename to generate multiple routes that match a given criteria. You can create several related pages at once, such as author pages, or a page for each blog tag.

> ðŸ’¡ Even dynamically-created pages and routes are generated at build time.

Astro pages that create dynamic routes must: 

1. use `[bracket]` notation to identify the dynamic parameters

2. export a `getStaticPaths()` function to specify exactly which paths will be pre-rendered by Astro.

```astro
// src/pages/dogs/[dog].astro
---
export function getStaticPaths() {
  const dogs = ["clifford", "rover", "spot"]; //array of routes to be generated

  return dogs.map((dog) => ({
    params: {
      dog,
    },
  }));
}
---

# routes generated:
mysite.com/dogs/clifford
mysite.com/dogs/rover
mysite.com/dogs/spot

```

### Named parameters

Routes can be generated from multiple named parameters, at any level of the filepath:

- `pages/blog/[slug].astro` â†’ (`/blog/hello-world`, `/blog/post-2`, etc.)
- `pages/[username]/settings.astro` â†’ (`/fred/settings`, `/drew/settings`, etc.)
- `pages/[lang]-[version]/info.astro` â†’ (`/en-v1/info`, `/fr-v2/info`, etc.)

#### Requesting the parameters

Astro components that generate routes dynamically have acess to an `Astro.request.params` object for each route. This allows you to use those generated parts of the URL in your component script and template.

```astro
---
// Example: src/pages/posts/[id].astro
const { id } = Astro.request.params;
---
<p>Post: { id }</p>


// Astro.reqest.params object passed for the route `/post/abc`
{ "id": "abc" }
```

Multiple dynamic route segments can be combined to work the same way. 

```astro
---
// Example: src/pages/post/[id]/[comment].astro
const { id, comment } = Astro.request.params;
---

// Astro.reqest.params object passed for the route `/post/abc/a-comment`
{ "id": "abc", "comment": "a-comment" }
```

### Rest parameters

If you need more flexibility in your URL routing, you can use a rest parameter in your `.astro` filename as a universal catch-all for file paths of any depth by adding three dots (`...`) inside your brackets. 

For example:

- `pages/post/[...slug].astro` â†’ (`/post/a`, `/post/a/b`, `/post/a/b/c`, etc.)

Matched parameters will be passed as a query parameter (`slug` in the example) to the page.

```json
// Astro.request.params object passed for the route `/post/a/b/c`
{ "slug": "a/b/c" }
```

> Rest parameters are optional by default, so `pages/post/[...slug].astro` could match `/post/` as well.

#### Example: Rest parameters

For a real-world example, you can implement GitHubâ€™s file viewer with the following named and rest paramenters:

```
/[org]/[repo]/tree/[branch]/[...file]
```

In this example, a request for `/withastro/astro/tree/main/docs/public/favicon.svg` would result in the following parameters being available to the page:

```js
{
	org: 'withastro',
	repo: 'astro',
	branch: 'main',
	file: 'docs/public/favicon.svg'
}
```

### Caveats

Query requests for parameters will not necessarily match every existing route in your project.

Static routes without path params will take precedence over all other routes, and will not match queries for dynamic path params. Similarly, named path routes take precedence over catch-all routes, and will not match queries for catch-all path params.

Consider the following project:

```
â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create.astro
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [pid].astro
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [...slug].astro

```

  - `pages/post/create.astro` - Will match `/post/create`
  
  - `pages/post/[pid].astro` - Will match `/post/1`, `/post/abc`, etc. But not `/post/create`

  - `pages/post/[...slug].astro` - Will match `/post/1/2`, `/post/a/b/c`, etc. But not `/post/create`, `/post/1`, `/post/abc`

  ## Pagination


Astro supports built-in, automatic pagination for large collections of data that need to be split into multiple pages. Astro also automatically includes pagination metadata for things like previous/next page URL, total number of pages, and more.

### When to use pagination

Pagination is only useful when you need to generate multiple, numbered pages from a larger data set.

If all of your data can fit on a single page then you should consider using a static [page component](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages) instead.

If you need to split your data into multiple pages but do not want those page URLs to be numbered, then you should use a [dynamic page](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes) instead without pagination (Example: `/tag/[tag].astro`).

### How to add pagination

#### 1. Create your page component

To automatically paginate some data, you'll first need to create your page component. This is the component `.astro` file that every page in the paginated collection will inherit from.

Pagination is built on top of dynamic page routing, with the page number in the URL represented as a dynamic route param: `[page].astro` or `[...page].astro`. If you aren't familiar with routing in Astro, quickly familiarize yourself with [dynamic routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes) before continuing.

Your first page URL will be different depending on which type of query param you use:

- `/posts/[page].astro` will generate the URLs `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, `/posts/3`, etc.
- `/posts/[...page].astro` will generate the URLs `/posts`, `/posts/2`, `/posts/3`, etc.

#### 2. Call the `paginate()` function

Once you have decided on the file name/path for your page component, you'll need to export a [`getStaticPaths()`](/en/reference/api-reference#getstaticpaths) function from the component. This tells Astro which page routes to build.

`getStaticPaths()` provides the `paginate()` function that Astro uses to paginate your data. 

In the example below, we'll use `paginate()` to split a list of 150 Pokemon into 15 pages of 10 Pokemon each.

```js
export async function getStaticPaths({ paginate }) {
  // Load your data with fetch(), Astro.fetchContent(), etc.
  const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=150`);
  const result = await response.json();
  const allPokemon = result.results;
  // Return a paginated collection of paths for all posts
  return paginate(allPokemon, { pageSize: 10 });
}
// If set up correctly, The page propÂ now has everything that
// you need to render a single page (see next section).
const { page } = Astro.props;
```

>The `paginate()` function:
>
>1. creates a new URL for every page of the collection by generating array of path objects for `getStaticPaths()`. 
>
>2. passes page data as a `page` prop to the `.astro` page component.

#### 3. Using the `page` prop

Once you've set up your page component and defined your `getStaticPaths()` function, you're ready to design your page template. Each page in the paginated collection will be passed its data in the `page` prop.

```astro
---
export async function getStaticPaths { /* ... */ }
const { page } = Astro.props;
---
<h1>Page {page.currentPage}</h1>
<ul>
  {page.data.map(item => <li>{item.title}</li>)}
</ul>
```

The `page` prop has several useful properties, but the most important one is `page.data`. This is the array containing the pageâ€™s slice of data that you passed to the `paginate()` function. 

For example, if you called `paginate()` on an array of 150 Pokemon:

- `/1`: `page.data` would be an array of the first 10 Pokemon
- `/2`: `page.data` would be an array of Pokemon 11-20
- `/3`: `page.data` would be an array of Pokemon 21-30
- etc. etc.

The `page` prop includes other helpful metadata, like `page.url.next`, `page.url.prev`, `page.total`, and more. See our [API reference](/en/reference/api-reference#the-pagination-page-prop) for the full `page` interface.

### Nested pagination

A more advanced use-case for pagination is **nested pagination.** This is when pagination is combined with other dynamic route params. You can use nested pagination to group your paginated collection by some property or tag.

For example, if you want to group your paginated markdown posts by some tag, you would use nested pagination by creating a `/src/pages/[tag]/[page].astro` page that would match the following URLS:

- `/red/1` (tag=red)
- `/red/2` (tag=red)
- `/blue/1` (tag=blue)
- `/green/1` (tag=green)

Nested pagination works by returning an array of `paginate()` results from `getStaticPaths()`, one for each grouping. 

In the following example, we will implement nested pagination to build the URLs listed above:

```astro
---
// Example: /src/pages/[tag]/[page].astro
export function getStaticPaths({paginate}) {
  const allTags = ['red', 'blue', 'green'];
  const allPosts = Astro.fetchContent('../../posts/*.md');
  // For every tag, return a paginate() result.
  // Make sure that you pass `{params: {tag}}` to `paginate()`
  // so that Astro knows which tag grouping the result is for.
  return allTags.map((tag) => {
    const filteredPosts = allPosts.filter((post) => post.tag === tag);
    return paginate(filteredPosts, {
      params: { tag },
      pageSize: 10
    });
  });
}
const { page } = Astro.props;
const { params } = Astro.request;
```
